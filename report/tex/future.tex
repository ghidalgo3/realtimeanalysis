\section{Future work}\label{future}
This section describes what future work needs to be done to improve the project.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add units to all attributes that need them. for example,
    the worst case execution time of tasks could be in milliseconds
    or microseconds. Consistency is important in this because
    the code would have to be modified with unit conversions.
    \item Better Sirius diagrams with more functionality. Altough it
    is possible to edit the model entirely from the tree editor, it is
    error prone and difficult. This would require serious knowledge of
    sirius best practices.
    \item More analysis algorithms.
    \item Cycle detection in the network is a little harder because JGraphT does
    not provide an undirected graph cycle checker. I would like to avoid writing
    the algorithm but apparently 
    \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/526331/cycles-in-an-undirected-graph}{\textbf{it is not so hard}}. 
    \item The analysis algorithms expect that the model is valid. This is too optimistic.
    \item Currently the \texttt{ModelInterface} class receives the model once it is validated. There should be a better way to reference the model besides waiting for the user to validate the model.
\end{enumerate}
