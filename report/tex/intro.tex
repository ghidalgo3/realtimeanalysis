\section{Introduction}
This report describes the design and implementation of an Eclipse
plug-in for the purpose of designing real-time systems based
on the ARINC 653 standard for integrated modular avionics and
ARINC 664 for network connections. The plug-in defines a 
meta-model for a system which can be used by several algorithms
to analytically ensure schedulability stability and an upper
bound on the network delay for frames sent over a network. 
The plug-in also has a comprehensive validation suite which
prevents users from creating structurally invalid configurations
along with a graphical editor for the network definition which
greatly helps to describe and debug network configurations.
