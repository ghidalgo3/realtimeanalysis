\section{Future Work}
This section describes what future work needs to be done to improve the project
and the steps required to start that work.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add units to all attributes that need them. For example,
    the worst case execution time of tasks could be in milliseconds
    or microseconds. Consistency is important in this because
    the code would have to be modified with unit conversions.
    \item Better Sirius diagrams with more functionality. Altough it
    is possible to edit the model entirely from the tree editor, it is
    error prone and difficult. This would require serious knowledge of
    Sirius best practices.
    \item More analysis algorithms.
\end{enumerate}
